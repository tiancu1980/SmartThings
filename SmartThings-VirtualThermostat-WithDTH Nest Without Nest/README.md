SmartThings-VirtualThermostat-WithDTH Nest Without Nest
Virtual Thermostat Device with Device Type Hander to create a proper thermostat device (Works With Google Home and Alexa)

Simply allows the creation of a new Device thats shows as a thermostat, using the teperature from a selected temperature sensor, and an on off outlet for heating also allows a contact sensor to disable the thermostat when open (no heating when window/door is open) (optional)

a lot of the code is from the Samsung SmartThings Virtual Thermostat example and lots of the UI elements and a bit of code came from NST-Manager Thermostat Handler

install both the smartapp and the device handler otherwise nothing will work, once setup it should be pretty strait forward.

Send me a Tweet at @eliotstocker if you want to discuss further
